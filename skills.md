 <h3> Ability to learn quickly </h3>
  <p>In 16 weeks at Makers, I have used Ruby, Javascript, Go, python, React and Rails to build programs.
  During a bootcamp, there is not really an option to take time out or learn at anything other than a breakneck pace.
  Fortunately, I enjoyed the course so much that I thrived despite these pressures and was able to pick things up quickly and with enthusiasm.
  Learning anything by yourself is a necessary skill for any developer. But of course it is more than just sitting in front of your laptop and teaching yourself. It is knowing when to ask for help, which questions to ask, where to look for information, and I always enjoy the research and learning from colleagues.</p>

  <h3> Pair programming / Teamwork  </h3>
  <p>I have used pair programming everyday at Makers following the driver/navigator style and ping-pong pairing style.
  Programming is not a solo activity and the most successful projects are built on a range of ideas and experiences. I always enjoy working with others and  recognise that everyone brings value to the table. I am able to articulate my ideas clearly and able to work at any speed to ensure my team are all on the same page. I am comfortable to lead with strong ideas and defer to and support my teammates with theirs.</p>

  <h3> Test driven development </h3>
  <p> I may be biased, since this is the only way I have been taught, but TDD is by far my preferred way to program. Through the discipline of TDD I am confident that my code is clean, easy to read and, most importantly for me and my teammates, easy to maintain. I use TDD as part of my strategy for approaching and understanding a problem. </p> 

 <h3> Client management</h3>
  <p>In a previous role I occasionally had to handle clients who felt they had not received a satisfactory service. I was able to deal with problems swiftly and directly, usually over the phone with very little notice, and ensure that clients maintained their confidence in us for future transactions. Such problems often arose when personnel did not show up for roles, and it was my duty to find adequate replacement within a very tight timeframe.</p>

  <h3>Personnel management</h3>
  <p>In my role as an operational administrator, I was tasked to ensure all personnel were assigned to roles which suited their availability and capabilities while dealing with the demands of clients.</p>

  <h3>Project coordination</h3>

  <p>In the same role mentioned above, my principle task was to coordinate between approximately 1000 employees and more than 50 clients. Calls from clients demanding staff had to be answered immediately, then a suitable candidate found and assigned in short order. Assignments already underway needed to be monitored simultaneously, and any problems likewise handled at once. My strong organisational and time management skills allowed me to get all those tasks done.</p>
