<p> After completing my MSc in Drug Discovery and Pharma Management and working in the field for a while, I realised that I wasn't passionate about this subject. It wasn't until I started coding that I understood what being passionate about something really means. Now after 16 weeks of studying at <a href='https://makers.tech/become/makers-academy'>Makers Academy</a>, I can't wait to keep learning and challenging myself.</p>
